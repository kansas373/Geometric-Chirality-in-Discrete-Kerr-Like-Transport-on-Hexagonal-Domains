This repository contains the code and data used in the study  
*Geometric Chirality in Discrete Kerr–Like Transport on Hexagonal Domains*.

The simulations explore whether parity-odd (chiral) observables can arise
from discrete geometric structure alone, without imposing gauge fields
or energetic asymmetries by hand.

We construct hexagonal point lattices, generate closed transport loops,
and measure signed loop observables under paired ±aₖₑᵣᵣ transport.
Both positive signals and null regimes are observed, depending on
sampling density and geometric constraints.

The goal of this repository is reproducibility and further iteration,
not definitive claims.
